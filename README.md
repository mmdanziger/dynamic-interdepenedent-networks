# dynamic-interdepenedent-networks

Code used for my PhD research on the topic of dynamic interdependent networks. This code was used for these papers:

Danziger, M.M. et al. Dynamic interdependence and competition in multilayer networks. Nature Phys 15, 178â€“185 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-018-0343-1

and 

Danziger, M.M. et al. Explosive synchronization coexists with classical synchronization in the Kuramoto model Chaos 26, 065307 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4953345


The GPU simulations were implemented using the code previously shared at 
https://github.com/mmdanziger/multilayer-cudamoto

This repo contains the python scripts used for the theoretical side of those works, including calculating self-consistent solutions, plotting results, and some helpers for launching and processing the results of the GPU simulations. There's even an sqlite db for storing and processing simulation results.

If you make use of the code please let me know, and cite the above papers. 

If there are any questions, reach out here or via email, I will try to help. It has been 10 years since I wrote this code and I may not remember all the details. 

If you find a mistake, please PR it for future users!
